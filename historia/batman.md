# Historia de Batman
The first Batman story, "The Case Of The Chemical Syndicate," was published in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939).

Bill Finger has said: "Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps."

This influence was evident with Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals.

Batman proved a hit character and received his own solo title in 1940, while continuing to star in Detective Comics. By that time, National Publications (the comic book division that would become DC Comics) was the top-selling and most influential publisher in the industry. Batman and the company's other major hero, Superman, were the cornerstones of the company's success.

Over the course of the first few Batman comics, several elements were added to the character, and the artistic depiction of Batman evolved. Bob Kane noted that within six issues he drew the character's jawline more pronounced, and lengthened the ears on the costume: "About a year later he was almost the full figure, my mature Batman," Kane said.

Batman's characteristic utility belt was introduced in Detective Comics #29 (July 1939), followed by the boomerang-like batarang and the first bat-themed vehicle, the Batplane, in #31 (September 1939).

Batman's origin was revealed in Detective Comics #33 (November 1939), unfolding in a two-page story (see below) that establishes the brooding persona of Batman, a character driven by the death of his parents. Written by Finger, it depicts a young Bruce Wayne witnessing his parents' murder at the hands of a mugger. The child vows that "by the spirits of my parents to avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals."
